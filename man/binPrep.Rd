\title{Binning function of radiocarbon dates.}
\usage{
binPrep(sites, ages, h, method = "complete")
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{a vector of character strings (or number to coerce to character) of all sites or site phases. If character strings are used these should not contain underscores (see also below)}

\item{ages}{a vector of uncalibrated conventional radiocarbon ages or a \code{CalDates} class object obtained using the \code{\link[rcarbon]{calibrate}} function.}

\item{h}{a single numeric value passed to \code{\link[stats]{cutree}} control degree of grouping of similar ages in a phase site.}

\item{method}{the agglomeration method to be used, passed on to \code{\link[stats]{hclust}}. Defaults to "complete" as in \code{\link[stats]{hclust}}.}
}
\value{
A vector of character strings with the same length of the object supplied for the argument \code{ages} identifying intra-site or intra-phase grouping, for use with \code{\link[rcarbon]{spd}}.The character strings effectively provide a "name" for each "phase" within a "site", using sequential integers after an underscore. For example if a site named "S001" had four dates grouped into two bins with two dates each, the resulting vector would be "S001_1", "S001_1", "S001_2", and "S001_2".
}
\description{
Prepare a set of bins for controlling the aggregation of radiocarbon dates
known to be from the same phase of same archaeological site (for use with \code{\link[rcarbon]{spd}}). Used in cases where there is a concern that unusually high levels of sampling for radiocarbon at a given site or in a given site phase will impede comparison between sites or phases.
}
\details{
If \code{ages} is a \code{CalDates} class object, median dates are used for the clustering.

\code{\link[rcarbon]{spd}} for generating SPD; \code{\link[rcarbon]{binsense}} for sensitivity analysis pertaining the choice of the parameter \code{h}.

\title{Computes rates of change from SPDs}
\usage{
spd2rc(
  spd,
  breaks = NULL,
  backsight = NULL,
  changexpr = expression((t1/t0)^(1/d) - 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spd}{Summed Probability Distribution obtained using the \code{\link[rcarbon]{spd}} function.}

\item{breaks}{A vector giving the breakpoints between the time-blocks.}

\item{backsight}{A single numeric value defining the distance in time between the focal year and the backsight year for computing the rate of change.}

\item{changexpr}{An expression defining how the rate of change is calculated, where \code{t1} is the summed probability for a focal block or year, \code{t0} is the summed probability for previous block or backsight year, and \code{d} is the duration of the block or the length of the backsight. Default is a geometric growth rate (i.e \code{expression((t1/t0)^(1/d)-1)}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{spdRC}.
}
\description{
Function for computing rates of change between abutting user-defined time-blocks.
}
\details{
When the argument \code{breaks} is supplied the function aggregates the summed probability within each time-block and compared them across abutting blocks using the expression defined by \code{changexpr}. When the argument \code{backsight} is provided he expression is based on the comparison between the summed probability of each year and the associated backsight year.
